Perceptual Learning Task created by Marta Topor  
University of Copenhagen   

### Introduction  
The task has been created for children who are 5-6 years old so that they can practice to distinguish letters "m" and "n". The game has a theme of a jungle game.   

The experimenter shows letters "m" and "n" to the participating child. The child can either practice saying the sounds of these letters (vocal group), making hand movements compatible with the sign language ("movement group") or both (vocal & movement group).  

Once children practice how to distinguish the letters (vocally/with movements), they begin a treasure hun game. There is a treasure map which can be used to trace child's progress after they finish each block and get closer to the treasure chest.  

Each trial consist of a fixation cross. The child is instructed to press down the space bar with their right hand, whilst the left hand rests on the side. Once the space bar is pressed, there is a jittered period before the stimuli come on the screen. The stimuli consist of three diamond shapes with letters. The child is instructed to only look at the middle diamond & letter and make a distinction as to whether the letter is "m" or "n". Once the child knows what letter they are looking at, they will release the spacebar and this will me marked as their reaction time. The game will not continue onto the next trial until the reseacher presses the right arrow. The game does not mark correct/incorrect responses. This has to be done by the experimenter on a piece of paper.   

### Interpretation of RT results    
The interpretation of reaction times in the task might be a bit challenging.   
We want to know how long the spacebar was pressed for, which is calculated with "method 2" in the spreadsheet.
The time of spacebar release is calculated with "method x".  
The reaction time is then calculated with calculating the difference between "prac_stim.started" and "method x". This has to be calculated offline.
